# Good Writing

## Key ideas:
* The starting point of good writing is good reading
* Writing is not about following an obstacle course. Its supposed to be fun, motivating  and pleasurable.
* A piece of writing can have a life. It can use artistic style to build suspense and resolve it. Or say something contradictory to evoke interest.
* These elements can be observed and learned from when we read great pieces of writing.
