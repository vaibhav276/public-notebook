# A window onto the world

Spoken communication is very different from written communication. In spoken communication, its a two-way flow of info. Even if its only one person speaking, there are still a lot of cues that shape it up. But in written communication, the writer must imagine themselves in reader's shoes and there are no cues.

## Classifications
* Many kinds of writing are blends of two or more styles
* Classical style overlaps with plain and practical styles
* It seems like writer had the truth figured out in advance before writing it down. However, this might not have been the case while the writer wrote it. It just has to seem that way in classic style.
* This book focuses on classical style
### Classical Style
* In classical style writing, the writer is simply presenting the truth, not arguing for it or sorting it out as he writes.
* Things being pointed to are usually concrete, or presented in more concrete terms
* Brevity comes from elegance, not from lack of time
* Reader might have to work hard to see the point, but its worth it
* Example: *The early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese*
* Assumes equality between writer and reader. So reader feels like a genius.
### Romantic Style
* Writer is trying to express his idiosyncratic, emotional and mostly ineffable reactions to something
### Practical Style
* The language of memos, manuals, term papers, research papers
* Style guides such as "Strunk and White" are usually for practical style
* Writer and reader have well defined roles
* It is brief, to save time for reader
### Plain Style
* Everything is in plain view
* Reader needs no help in seeing anything
* Example: *The early bird gets the worm*
### Self-conscious/Relativistic/Postmodern Style
* Writer's chief concern is to escape the conviction of philosophical naivete

## Anti-patterns
### Meta-discourse/Signposting
* Explaining what sections are going to come next. 
* Another instance is explaining what sections have come in past, or both next and past
* Text looks like a form of table of contents.
* The list is too long for reader to keep in working memory, and hence it doesn't serve any good.
* Sometimes a little bit of signposting might be used to anchor the thoughts, but must be done carefully
### Not treating reader as a "viewer", or being there with you seeing what you see
* Referring to something that is said as "as it was said in previous paragraph", rather than "as we have seen"
### Summary not self contained
* Forcing the reader to jump back to previously read text to understand it
### Not enough focus on the subject
* Writers often talk about their profession, or whats happening in their fields. Rather than going directly to the subject about which they are writing. They assume readers are interested in how writer spends his time.
* Writers give too much emphasis on the way they deal with the subject, which is different from the subject itself.
* The text is inward looking, not classic style. Reason why academic texts are so tedious.
* **Personal comment:** This has been my frustration with many books I read
### Improper use of quotation marks
* Quotation marks makes the tone sarcastic
* Indicates the writer doesn't approve of the word used in this context
* Example: *She is a "good"*. Seems like the author wants to say she seems good, but actually isn't.
### Hedging/Cushioning
* Usage of words like *almost, apparently, seemingly, fairly, in part, virtually, sort of, to some degree, I would argue, presumably, allegedly, reportedly* etc.
* Sign of too much self-consciousness on writer's part. Doesn't usually help the reader.
* Good writing gives enough respect to reader to have common sense, and the writer doesn't always need to be painfully accurate and self-conscious.
* If a reader wants to attack the writer's text, they would find a way anyways.
* A legal document is an exception to this. There things do need to be spelled very carefully because an adversary will challenge it.
* Another exception would be scientific claims. *Men are better than women at math* would be too casual/inappropriate in a scientific writing. There we do need qualifiers so that the message is clear.
* Overall, hedging must be a conscious choice based on context.
### Intensifiers
* Usage of *very, highly, extremely* inappropriately.
* Example: *John couldn't steal this. He is a very honest man*. Honesty is a binary thing - someone is either honest or not.
* Mark Twain's advice: Substitute *damn* every time you are about to write *very*. The editor will delete it and writing will be just as it should be.
