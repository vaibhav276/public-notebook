# Sense of Style [*Steven Pinker*]

I really like this book as a practical guide or reference book on writing skills. I need such books in my library to be able to visit from time to time and takeaway something useful to learn and improve. It motivates me to write, and it might well be the reason I am writing this page.

To me writing isn't just an output tool, like a printer is to a computer. Its more of a reflection tool, like a mirror. I get my thoughts clarified in the process of writing. So anything that helps me write is in fact a tool that helps me think better.
